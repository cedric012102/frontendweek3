            <h2 class="bangers">About The Marvel Universe</h2>
            <p id="large-paragraph">Stan Lee is the most famous character in the history of comics, a testament to his talent as a writer and editor, his longevity and his skills for self-promotion are defining qualities. His editorial approach to the genre of superheroes created a universe of enduring fictional characters, taking the world of comics to a higher level of entertainment for children and adults, and helped establish the Marvel Comics brand as one of the most successful and famous publishing publishers. <br> <br>

                Along with artists and visual narrators like Jack Kirby, Steve Ditko, Don Heck and others, Lee contributed decisively to the creation of many of the comic book characters that populate the Marvel universe: the Fantastic Four, Hulk, Iron Man, Thor, Spider-Man and many other superheroes, villains and side characters. <br> <br>
                
                Lee’s career covered almost the entire history of comics: it began in 1940 at the dawn of what was to be known as the Golden Age of comics, continued as a driving force in the rebirth of the superhero genre in the Silver Age of the 1960s, and remained an important figure in the industry as president emeritus of Marvel Comics until his death, November 12, 2018 at the age of 95. <br> <br>
                
                Stanley Martin Leiber was born on December 28, 1922 and began his career in the world of comics at the age of 17 when he was hired by his relative, Martin Goodman, editor of Timely Comics (the company that would later become Marvel Comics), to be Office Assistant to publisher Joe Simon. <br> <br>
                
                When he was given the first opportunity to write a story, a short piece of text that appeared in Captain America # 3 of 1941, he signed his name as "Stan Lee". From there, his career was unstoppable. <br> <br>
                
                In his later years, Lee partnered with a wide range of publications and products, about which his creative involvement is somewhat uncertain. <br> <br>
                
                It continued to appear at comic book conventions and Marvel fan festivals until early 2018. His brief appearances have been a popular (and desired) feature in Marvel Comics character-based movies. <br> <br>
                
                Marvel’s comic genius leaves a rich legacy of stories and a lasting footprint on the industry it helped build. He played a decisive role in the transformation of comics so that they were not perceived as frivolous entertainment for children but in an important art form, to be taken into account. Characters created by Stan Lee continue and will continue to resonate in comics, movies, TV series and popular culture.</p>
